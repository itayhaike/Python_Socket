# Python_Socket_TFTP

TFTP is a simple protocol used to transfer files between devices on a network. 
It is useful for transferring small files, but lacks the security and error-checking of more robust protocols like FTP.

This script will allow you to transfer files over your pc by changing the path in the python code.
